					<h2>Tackling Config Management in Drupal 8</h2>
					<br />
					<p>By Zach Weishar</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>What can config managment do for you?</h3>
					<section>
						<p>Traditionally, Drupal is composed of two parts</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Code</p>
						<img data-src="img/code.svg" style="border:none;"/>
						<p>Database</p>
						<img data-src="img/database-1.svg" style="border:none;"/>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							In order to effectivley manage change in your application,
							you need a way to control the state of both of these pieces.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Managing change in code is relativley easy through the use of
							a version control system (VCS), such as GIT.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Unfortunatley the same is not true for the database. This is where
							configuration mangment comes into play.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							Configuration managment allows you to effectivley control the state
							of your database by exporting its configuration to code which can be
							managed in your VCS of choice.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>This is valuable because:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>You can easily deploy database updates between environments</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>You never loose vital changes to your database because its history is managed by your VCS.</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Where we came from</h3>
					<section>
						<p>In Drupal 7, configuration management is made possible by contributed modules, namely features and strong arm</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>This solution has treated us well for years, but it has some shortcomings:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									It lives in the contrib space, which means there is no centralized API in core for module developers to
									rely on
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Features was designed to bundle up small chunks of descrete site functionality, not act as full
									configuration store for a complex site
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>This can often lead to frustration:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><p>Configuration  becomes spread between multiple features modules, which makes it hard to keep track of</p></li>
							<li><p>Features modules can have interlocking dependencies, which makes changes harder down the road.</p></li>
							<li><p>Resolving merge conflicts in large features modules is tedious and error prone</p></li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Features is not dead, but now it is free to fulfill its original purpose!</p>
					</section>
				</section>

					<h3>What is considered configuration in Drupal 8?</h3>
					<section>
						<p>There are four main categories of data in Drupal 8</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>Content:</strong>
						<p>
							Information meant to be displayed on your site: articles, basic pages, images, files,
							custom blocks, etc. Content is stored and accessed using
							<a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21lib%21Drupal%21Core%21Entity%21entity.api.php/group/entity_api/8.2.x">
								Entities.
							</a>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>State:</strong>
						<p>
							Information of a temporary nature, generally machine-generated and not human-edited, about the current state of
							your site. Examples: the time when Cron was last run, whether node access permissions need rebuilding, etc.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>Use State API when:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><p>It is specific to an individual environment.</p></li>
							<li><p>You will never want to deploy it between environments.</p></li>
							<li><p>You can reset a system, losing all state. Its configuration remains.</p></li>
							<li>
								<p>So, use State API to store transient information, that is okay to lose after a reset.
								Think: CSRF tokens, tracking when something non-critical last happened</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>Session:</strong>
						<p>
							Information about individual users' interactions with the site, such as whether they are logged in. This is really
							"state" information, but it is not stored the same way so it's a separate type . Session information is available
							from the Request object.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>Configuration:</strong>
						<p>
							Information about your site that is generally (or at least can be) human-edited, but is not Content, and is
							meant to be relatively permanent. Examples: the name of your site, the content types and views you have defined, etc.
						</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>Things you should know about the CMS</h3>

					<section>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									The CMS is designed to move configuration between different instances of the same site, not between two
									separate sites.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									What this means is that you need to set up new environments from a database dump. An example
									would be starting your dev site from scratch, then creating both test and live sites from dumps of the dev
									database. This ensures the sites UUID's will match
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<strong>Configuration stores</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>The active configuration store is the one that is currently in use</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>When you first install Drupal, this is the database.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>When you export your configuration, you're exporting settings in the database to the file system, or from one store to another</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>The active configuration store is configurable, letting you swap it out as needed (Redis, MongoDB, etc)</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<strong>There are two types of configuration:</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>Simple: Used to store data that will only ever have one copy or version</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Configuration Entities: Used to store more complex data. There can be many instances of a single configuration
									entity. Some examples are views, content types, and image styles.
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<strong>Sites own configuration, not modules</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>
									Modules and themes can provide default configuration that is imported when they are first installed. This is found in a
									a module's config/install directory.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									Future updates to a modules yml files will have no affect. In order to update default config for a pre-installed
									module, you need to make the changes in a update hook (or uninstall / reinstall the module).
								</p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<p>
							In Drupal 7, all variables were global (think vset and vget), which means that they were loaded into memory on every page load.
							In Drupal 8, these variables are only loaded into memory when they are needed.
						</p>
					</section>

					<h3>CMS Tips</h3>
					<section>
						<p>
							It's still possible to override configuration in settings.php via the
							<a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/1928898">Configuration Override System</a>
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>
							By default, Drupal sets up a configuration sync folder (fill in path) on install, but you can change the location
							by overriding it in settings.php
						</p>
						<pre>
							<code>$config_directories = array(CONFIG_SYNC_DIRECTORY => '../config/sync');</code>
						</pre>
